=head1 NAME

linux_install - Installs the kernel and associated files.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

linux_install [ RELEASE_TAG ] [ SRC_DIR ] [ TARGET_DIR ] [ ARCH ]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

linux_install is a simple script to copy .config,
include/linux/autoconf.h, System.map, and the kernel image to /boot (or
other target directory as specified by the optional $TARGET_DIR
argument).  These files will be appended with -$RELEASE_TAG (which
defaults as '-test').

SRC_DIR can be specified to control where to look for the files to copy.
linux_install will exit with an error if this does not exist.  By
default it looks in the current working directory (".")

linux_install is written to be architecture-independent, and will locate
the kernel image by first looking in $SRC_DIR/$arch/boot/*, and then in
$SRC_DIR, for files named bzImage, vmlinuz, vmlinux, zImage.  It will
attempt to guess $arch using uname.  If it fails to detect correctly,
you can override it by specifying the $ARCH argument.

linux_install does not update the bootloader (see bootloader for that).
